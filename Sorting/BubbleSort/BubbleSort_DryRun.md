# Bubble Sort in Java -- Dry Run Example

## Input Array

    [13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Pass 1

\[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9\]\
→ \[13, 24, 46, 52, 20, 9\]\
→ \[13, 24, 46, 20, 52, 9\]\
→ \[13, 24, 46, 20, 9, 52\]

### Pass 2

\[13, 24, 46, 20, 9, 52\]\
→ \[13, 24, 20, 46, 9, 52\]\
→ \[13, 24, 20, 9, 46, 52\]

### Pass 3

\[13, 24, 20, 9, 46, 52\]\
→ \[13, 20, 24, 9, 46, 52\]\
→ \[13, 20, 9, 24, 46, 52\]

### Pass 4

\[13, 20, 9, 24, 46, 52\]\
→ \[13, 9, 20, 24, 46, 52\]

### Pass 5

\[13, 9, 20, 24, 46, 52\]\
→ \[9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Sorted Array

    [9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52]

## Notes

-   Bubble Sort compares **adjacent pairs** and swaps if needed.
-   After each pass, the largest element moves to its correct position.
-   `didSwap` optimizes the algorithm by stopping early if no swaps
    occur.
